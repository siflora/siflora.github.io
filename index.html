<h1><i>New Life Phase at Thingylabs</i></h1>
<p> I was trying to find a cool start for this blog but then I decided to go with the cheesist one:
Like they say, life is box of chocolates, you never know how the next tastes.
</p>
<p>As a German-literature-graduate, I never thought I would step my foot into the programming field before this summer.
Although the curiosity of computer science always itches me to learn more about this fasinating world.</p>
<p> It's said that opportunities are always there for the well-prepared. But I would argue sometimes you learn more when the opportunity comes while you're fully unprepared. In my first few weeks
at Thingylabs I was not only once hit by the moment, where I seriously questioned my intelligence and my courage.
It's not easy to come out of the comfort zone and jump into the cold water. However it forces you to face the true self, the advantages and
disadvantages and the potential you have. To know yourself and to
overcome the weaknesses are in my opion as important as, if not more important than, to learn some
useful skills like writing codes.</p>
<p> I would like to take this chance to thank Per, who not only gave me the opportunity at the
first place but has also always been supportive, also when I have those outsider questions; who at the same time gives me
the constructive uncomfortableness, which dragged me in this new phase of life, where I see a lot of
incredible possibilities. </p>
<p> I will record the progresses I make during my internship at Thingylabs for some day, where I can look back at all the steps from the very beginning to
the fully preparation. </p>
